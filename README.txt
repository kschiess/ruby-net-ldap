== What is this

This is not the official net-ldap repository. Please see

  https://github.com/ruby-ldap/ruby-net-ldap
  
Things in here may not work as you expect. I would strongly advise against 
using this, unless you know what you're doing. 

== License

Most of the code in this repository is from net-ldap and as such under a GPL 
license currently (will be MIT soon). I am not the original author. Please 
see the LICENSE file or the gemspec for correct credits. 

All my additions are under the MIT license, unless the GPL applies for formal 
reasons.
